    <section title="Introduction and Motivation">
      <t>An attribute is a representation of a single datum of information
      associated with an entity. Attributes types are defined by semantics and
      syntax that allow them to be used in a variety of protocols. This
      document lists requrements for a registry of such attribute type
      definitions. Historically, and still today, protocols that rely on the
      transfer of attributes (like OpenID Connect, OAUTH, WS-Federation or
      SAML) often rely on (at least in the case of attributes associated with
      accounts and persons) attribute type definitions that are borrowed from
      LDAP or X.509 schema even though those particular protocols no longer
      represent the common method to use attributes.</t>

      <t>Claims-based protocols are increasingly being used on the Internet. A
      common use-case for such protocols is to build identity federations that
      rely on the transfer of attribute-values as a means to communicate
      authorization-information. Identity federations are often purposed to
      specific communities and groups. Often such communities need to engage
      in transactions across federation boundries (eg when sharing services).
      This practice is called inter-federation. Inter-federation raises the
      need for a way to discover information about the attributes used in the
      protocols employed inside and between federations. </t>

      <t>This document attempts to address these problems by establishing a
      set of requirements for an Internet-wide registry of attribute-type
      definitions. This document does not attempt to establish the registry,
      that will be the work of future specifications.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Core Concerns">
      <t>In order to set the stage for and properly frame the registry
      requirements the following section lists a set of core concerns that
      MUST be address by the registry requirements proper:</t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Naming">
        <t>It is implied that attribute types have names that uniquely
        identify them. This requirement will be spelled out in detail below. A
        core concern implied by the existence of names is one of name
        management. A common way to implement name management is to structure
        the names in such a way as to establish name-spaces - parts of the
        name that can be allocated, delegated and used to stablish global
        uniqueness. </t>

        <t>Currently used attribute type definitions use a variety of name
        spaces including OIDs, URIs and URNs but there are also example of
        attribute type name aliasing and the use of commonly used
        short-names.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Locality">
        <t>There are two fundamental models for registries: centralized and
        distributed. In a central registry all the information is kept and
        maintained in one place whereas a distributed registry shares
        information in the registry over multiple cooperative instances that
        together make up the full registry. It is possible to concieve of
        hybrid models where for instance a central index is used to store
        referrals to a set of distributed nodes.</t>

        <t>The distributed model is most often used when there expected use of
        the registry would imply a very high load on a single registry
        instance. An example of a system with this property is the DNS. A
        distributed registry model has implications for requirements on lookup
        (cf below). Specifically the registry may need a central or well-known
        entry-point unless there is a mechanism for performing lookups.</t>

        <t>The central model by contrast is simpler in that no protocol needs
        to be specified for communicating between registry instances and that
        lookup can be handled to a single well know instance. This model may
        be preferred if the total amount of data in the registry is relatively
        small (at least compared to the DNS or systems of similar scale). The
        fact that the registry is operated in a single instance does not
        necessarily imply lowered requirements on availability and security.
        An example of this type of registry is the Time Zone Database (TODO -
        RFC reference).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Schema">
        <t>As was stated in the introduction LDAP and X.509 attribute schema
        is commonly used to describe attribute-types for claims-based
        protocols. Recently however there is a trend towards defining "raw
        attributes", i.e attribute types that are not supported by a
        corresponding directory schema. Thus there may be a need to define a
        "directory-neutral" attribute-type schema langue. In either case there
        will probably be a need to support multiple schema in the
        registry.</t>

        <t>Furthermore LDAP and X.509 schema have a property that is not used
        in claims-based protocols: objectClass definitions. These are schema
        elements that often list a set of mandatory and/or optional associated
        attributes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Lookup and Search">
        <t>Lookup and Search may appear to be very similar operations but they
        are in fact quite dissimilar in that they place very different
        requirements on the representation and schema of the data to be
        searched. To draw an example from the DNS again: The DNS supports
        lookup but not search. In other words it is possible to, given a
        domain name, lookup the corresponding records in the DNS but it is not
        in general possible to search for records given knowledge of part of a
        domain name.</t>

        <t>The choice of weather to support search or just lookup based on
        attribute names is a critical question to answer for the attribute
        registry.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use">
        <t>The core usage-question is this: will the attribute registry be
        used in conjunction with individual transactions or as a tool for
        configuration, discovery and information related to the task of
        setting up federations and other relationships using claims-based
        protocols. The former use-case requires a global service available 247
        while the latter requires the availability typically found in a
        website providing documentation.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Attributes are often used to carry sensitive information as part of
      claims-based protocols. It is common for claims to contain attribute
      values that are used to allow or deny access to a protected resource.
      Some attributes carry identifiers as values. A discussion of the
      security implications of handling identifiers can be found in <xref
