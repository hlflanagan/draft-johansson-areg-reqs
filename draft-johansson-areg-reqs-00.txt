Internet-Draft       Attribute Registry Requirements          March 2011


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   An attribute is a representation of a single datum of information
   associated with an entity.  Attributes types are defined by semantics
   and syntax that allow them to be used in a variety of protocols.
   This document lists requrements for a registry of such attribute type
   definitions.  Historically, and still today, protocols that rely on
   the transfer of attributes (like OpenID Connect, OAUTH, WS-Federation
   or SAML) often rely on (at least in the case of attributes associated
   with accounts and persons) attribute type definitions that are
   borrowed from LDAP or X.509 schema even though those particular
   protocols no longer represent the common method to use attributes.

   Claims-based protocols are increasingly being used on the Internet.
   A common use-case for such protocols is to build identity federations
   that rely on the transfer of attribute-values as a means to
   communicate authorization-information.  Identity federations are
   often purposed to specific communities and groups.  Often such
   communities need to engage in transactions across federation
   boundries (eg when sharing services).  This practice is called inter-
   federation.  Inter-federation raises the need for a way to discover
   information about the attributes used in the protocols employed
   inside and between federations.

   This document attempts to address these problems by establishing a
   set of requirements for an Internet-wide registry of attribute-type
   definitions.  This document does not attempt to establish the
   registry, that will be the work of future specifications.


2.  Core Concerns

   In order to set the stage for and properly frame the registry
   requirements the following section lists a set of core concerns that
   MUST be address by the registry requirements proper:

2.1.  Naming

   It is implied that attribute types have names that uniquely identify
   them.  This requirement will be spelled out in detail below.  A core
   concern implied by the existence of names is one of name management.
   A common way to implement name management is to structure the names
   in such a way as to establish name-spaces - parts of the name that
   can be allocated, delegated and used to stablish global uniqueness.

   Currently used attribute type definitions use a variety of name
   spaces including OIDs, URIs and URNs but there are also example of
   attribute type name aliasing and the use of commonly used short-

   names.

2.2.  Data Locality

   There are two fundamental models for registries: centralized and
   distributed.  In a central registry all the information is kept and
   maintained in one place whereas a distributed registry shares
   information in the registry over multiple cooperative instances that
   together make up the full registry.  It is possible to concieve of
   hybrid models where for instance a central index is used to store
   referrals to a set of distributed nodes.

   The distributed model is most often used when there expected use of
   the registry would imply a very high load on a single registry
   instance.  An example of a system with this property is the DNS.  A
   distributed registry model has implications for requirements on
   lookup (cf below).  Specifically the registry may need a central or
   well-known entry-point unless there is a mechanism for performing
   lookups.

   The central model by contrast is simpler in that no protocol needs to
   be specified for communicating between registry instances and that
   lookup can be handled to a single well know instance.  This model may
   be preferred if the total amount of data in the registry is
   relatively small (at least compared to the DNS or systems of similar
   scale).  The fact that the registry is operated in a single instance
   does not necessarily imply lowered requirements on availability and
   security.  An example of this type of registry is the Time Zone
   Database (TODO - RFC reference).

2.3.  Schema

   As was stated in the introduction LDAP and X.509 attribute schema is
   commonly used to describe attribute-types for claims-based protocols.
   Recently however there is a trend towards defining "raw attributes",
   i.e attribute types that are not supported by a corresponding
   directory schema.  Thus there may be a need to define a "directory-
   neutral" attribute-type schema langue.  In either case there will
   probably be a need to support multiple schema in the registry.

   Furthermore LDAP and X.509 schema have a property that is not used in
   claims-based protocols: objectClass definitions.  These are schema
   elements that often list a set of mandatory and/or optional
   associated attributes.

2.4.  Lookup and Search

   Lookup and Search may appear to be very similar operations but they
   are in fact quite dissimilar in that they place very different
   requirements on the representation and schema of the data to be
   searched.  To draw an example from the DNS again: The DNS supports
   lookup but not search.  In other words it is possible to, given a
   domain name, lookup the corresponding records in the DNS but it is
   not in general possible to search for records given knowledge of part
   of a domain name.

   The choice of weather to support search or just lookup based on
   attribute names is a critical question to answer for the attribute
   registry.

2.5.  Use

   The core usage-question is this: will the attribute registry be used
   in conjunction with individual transactions or as a tool for
   configuration, discovery and information related to the task of
   setting up federations and other relationships using claims-based
   protocols.  The former use-case requires a global service available
   247 while the latter requires the availability typically found in a
   website providing documentation.

6.  Security Considerations

   Attributes are often used to carry sensitive information as part of
   claims-based protocols.  It is common for claims to contain attribute
   values that are used to allow or deny access to a protected resource.
   Some attributes carry identifiers as values.  A discussion of the
   security implications of handling identifiers can be found in
   draft-iab-identifier-comparison [I-D.iab-identifier-comparison].
